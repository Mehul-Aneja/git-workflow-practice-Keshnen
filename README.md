## Response (What I Find Interesting)
### The article by Dustin Volz “Biden Administration Forms Cybersecurity Review Board to Probe Failures” from the Wall Street Journal discusses an approach that the United States government is taking to boost Cyber Resilience. As a cybersecurity minor, I found the roles and responsibilities assigned to this new task force interesting. First, I was surprised that it wasn't an independent taskforce–which would give it more transparency and accountability. Secondly, I thought it was unique that the board was not focused on assigning fault for cyber attacks that occur, but rather is simply focused on finding solutions against cyber threats on a whole. While this is indeed useful, it does not further incentivise private companies to do their part (or risk penalty) as they aren't being directly investigated. However, I believe that this task force at the end of the day will be beneficial as it will provide developers guidance on how to harden their products against emerging cyber threats when developing software.
